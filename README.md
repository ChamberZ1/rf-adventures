# rf-adventures
Stuff I do with an RTL-SDR v4 and Windows laptop. I became interested in radio frequencies (RF) when I was doing research on Wi-Fi hacking (specifically the difference between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi). I learned that so many things that I use have to do with RF: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, Microwaves, radio, etc. So, I began researching RF as it was so fascinating, but the more I dug, the more complex it got. I am a hands-on learner so I figured I'd acquire an RTL-SDR dongle and start out with simpler goals like tuning in to radio stations, public police radio, and air traffic. I'm documenting my journey here so I can come back and review my notes. I'll do occasional clean-ups as this repo expands.
